<p>I am a passionate roboticist. I grew up in India playing soccer and even today I don't miss any opportunity for a quick game.</p>
<p>My main interests lie in the intersection of <strong>deep learning and autonomous robots</strong>. I want to help make systems that make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Previously I worked with <a class="reference external" href="link:https://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a>, <a class="reference external" href="link:https://www.cranfield.ac.uk">Cranfield University</a>
I will graduate from Arizona State University in May' 21, where I have been part of exciting research projects and courses.</p>
<p>Most of my technical work is on <a class="reference external" href="link:&quot;https://github.com/gautam-sharma1&quot;">GitHub</a></p>

<p>My favourite quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persits in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man</em></p>
