<h1>A multi UAV system to assist with search and rescue operations in disaster affected regions</h1>
<p>I had a lot of fun working on multi robots last semester. For our final project of Multi Robot Systems, me and Yash Mandlik developed a
multi UAV system to assist with search and rescue operations in disaster affected regions.
We used computer vision techniques and object detection (YOLO) to detect missing or stranded humans. Specifically we used

All the attractive (formation) and repulsive (obstacle avoidance) potential functions were designed and tuned fully using MATLAB.</p>
