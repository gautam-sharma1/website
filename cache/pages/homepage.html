<p>I am Gautam Sharma, a passionate roboticist. I grew up in India playing soccer and even today I don't miss any opportunity for a quick game.</p>
<p>My main interests lie in the intersection of deep learning and autonomous robots. I want to help make systems that make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Previously I worked with <a class="reference external" href="link:https://www.mathworks.com&quot;">MathWorks</a>, <a class="reference external" href="link:&quot;https://www.cranfield.ac.uk&quot;">Cranfield University</a>
