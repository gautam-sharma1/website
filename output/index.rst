I am Gautam Sharma, a passionate roboticist. I grew up in India playing soccer and even today I don't miss any opportunity for a quick game.

My main interests lie in the intersection of deep learning and autonomous robots. I want to help make systems that make a difference in the world.

Previously I worked with `MathWorks <link:https://www.mathworks.com">`__, `Cranfield University <link:"https://www.cranfield.ac.uk">`__
I will graduate from Arizona State University in May' 21, where I have been part of exciting research projects and courses.

Most of my technical work is on `GitHub <link:"https://github.com/gautam-sharma1">`__

My favourite quote:

    *The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persits in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man*
